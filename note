- StrictARP

If you’re using kube-proxy in IPVS mode, since Kubernetes v1.14.2 you have to 
enable strict ARP mode.

Note, you don’t need this if you’re using kube-router as service-proxy because 
it is enabling strict ARP by default.

Currently in some clusters it's needed to set strictARP: true, so that 
externalTrafficPolicy: Local correctly works (baremetal + metallb).

- Replicaset

A ReplicaSet (RS) is a Kubernetes object used to maintain a stable set of 
replicated pods running within a cluster at any given time.

- Rewrite target ingress

nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target	
Target URI where the traffic must be redirected	string

- PathType : Prefix

Prefix: Matches based on a URL path prefix split by /. Matching is case 
sensitive and done on a path element by element basis. A path element 
refers to the list of labels in the path split by the / separator. A request is 
a match for path p if every p is an element-wise prefix of p of the request path.

- Replace this <b> tag with <strong>.

The <strong>/<b> and <em>/<i> tags have exactly the same effect in most web browsers, 
but there is a fundamental difference between them: <strong> and <em> have a semantic 
meaning whereas <b> and <i> only convey styling information like CSS.

- Perbedaan declarative pipeline dan scripted

Declarative dan Scripted hanya berbeda di pendekatan programming nya saja
Declarative pipeline selalu diawali dengan kata pipeline di lain sisi
Scripted selalu diawali dengan kata node, declarative bisa terdiri dari banyak steps
Declarative lebih mudah untuk di maintain dan lebih mudah untuk digunakan
